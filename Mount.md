# Mount

There are two main types of mount;

- With posture (body perpendicular to opponent)
- Without posture (body parallel to opponent)

The main objective after mount, is to get to **high mount**ï¼Œwhere your knees are high into their armpits, allowing attacks like the armbar to be done more easily.

One thing you really don't want your opponent to do is for them to get their elbows inside your knees.

- Hide feet very close to opponents ass _(This is help avoid opponent reguarding by capturing the foot and coming to half guard)_
- Grip fighting is very important, make sure to be trying to control the arms of your opponent
- Your opponent will have to bridge, when they do, get the **long hook** _(one leg is under opponent perpendicular to their spine, outside leg is pressed on their back)_ The long hook is useful when your opponent is on their side because it helps prevent them hip escaping, if they come back to their back, release the long hook and place feet back close to opponents ass
- If your opponent has big explosive bridges, don't try and ride them and maintain a postured mount, bring body closer and try and cross face, this will bring you into an _unpostured mount_
- Do not place hands far from opponent when their bridge and you post, try and keep everything tight, do not give them space
- In a postured position, grab cross arm with palm facing up (strong and only way to break it is for opponent to move arm in the direction we want)
- Force arm to the mat, then change arm to be same side (e.g. my right arm controlling their left)
- Pressure their top shoulder, and use left arm to gift wrap their left arm, this will now bring you into an _unpostured mount_
- They will most likely try and crunch and put their left elbow inside my right knee, with the now free right arm, use it to control their left arm elbow and force upwards
- This will create space for you to slide up into a high mount
