# Armbar

## From positions

The following are useful links from other positions

### From closed guard

- Control one or both of your opponents arms
- Bring outer leg out and block your opponents far shoulder
- While keep blocking your opponents shoulder, bring inner leg up into armpit, switch hips, and kick over to unbalance opponent
- Far leg should now be much easier to move over opponents head
- Lean body back, raise hips, opponents thumb pointing up

### From a mount position

- Control one or both of your opponents arms
- Keep weight and pressure on opponents chest
- Re position inner leg so foot is pointing towards opponents head
- Lean body away from opponents head, maintaining pressure
- Re position outer leg so leg is over opponents face
- Regarding locking feet:
  - ✅ Foot from leg over face can be under the lock
  - ❌ Foot from leg over face can be over the lock (Leaves too much space for opponent to work with)
- Lean body back, raise hips, opponents thumb pointing up
